# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
Cardiovascular diseases are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. The risk of certain cardiovascular diseases may be increased by smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and obesity. The diagnosis of heart disease is a difficult task that can provide an automated prediction about the patient's heart health to improve the effectiveness of subsequent treatment. Medical data are widely available in the health sector. Therefore,to make better choices in the prediction of heart diseases, machine learning algorithms are needed. Boosting algorithms combine multiple weak learners to a strong learner in a sequentially manner which iteratively improves the observations. The prediction of cardiovascular disease is important since it allows for the possibility of saving lives. The results are shown separately to provide comparisons. Based on the results, the analysis led to a conclusion that the proposed model produced highest accuracy with 89% while using XG Boost.
